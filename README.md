# Blog Application

The "Blog app" is a website created by Heta Trivedi where people can read blog posts and show their appreciation by clicking an upvote button. Users can also engage by leaving comments on the blog posts. The website was built using a set of technologies called MERN, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These technologies are commonly used together for creating websites that seamlessly function from the front-end to the back-end.

And the "Blog app" isn't just a conceptâ€”it's a fully functional website that you can visit [here](https://mern-395505.el.r.appspot.com/). You can explore the blog posts, upvote them, leave comments, and interact with the content.

## Features

- User registration and login system with Authentication and Authorization.

## Tech Stack
